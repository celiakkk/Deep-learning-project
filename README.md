# Cryptocurrency price prediction in deep learning models 

## Abstract 
The objective of the project is to leverage deep learning models to predict the future prices of cryptocurrency. Recurrect neural networks(RNN) have demonstrated strong learning techniques in time-series data prediction. This is due to their ability to remember and extract the temporal features of data.  Another most well-known and successful linear statistical model for time series prediction is ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average). In this project, we explore the recurrent neural network architectures and incorporate strategic statistical model approaches for cryptocurrency price forecasting.
