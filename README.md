# Cryptocurrency price prediction in deep learning models 

## Abstract 

The objective of the project is to leverage deep learning models to predict the future prices of cryptocurrency. Recurrect neural networks(RNN) have demonstrated strong learning techniques in time-series data prediction. This is due to their ability to remember and extract the temporal features of data.  Another most well-known and successful linear statistical model for time series prediction is ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average). In this project, we create a hybrid model of Bidirectional LSTM and ARIMA for cryptocurrency price forecasting.
